# 📦 Project Setup

## 🧩 Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

## 🛠️ Environment Setup - Only if Required by the assignment in Canvas

> **Note:** Most projects require **Python 3.10+**.  
> Some modules may also use **Docker** — see below.

### Setting up Python Environment

1. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Using Docker (If applicable)

> Skip this section if the project does not use Docker.

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm <image-name>
```

(You can also add volume mounts or ports here if needed.)

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Without Docker

```bash
python main.py
```

(Adjust if the project uses a different entry point.)

### With Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm <image-name>
```

---

## 📝 Submission Instructions (If Applicable)

- Push your completed code to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Module X"
git push origin main
```

- Submit the GitHub repository link as instructed.

# 📋 Notes
- Make sure you have **GIT**, **Python 3.10+**, and **Docker** (if needed) installed.
- Configure your SSH keys for GitHub if you haven't already. ([Guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh))

# Example Usage for Your Course

When you start a new module repo, you would just **copy this README**, replace:  
- `<repository-url>` with the real GitHub URL  
- `<repository-directory>` with the repo folder  
- `<image-name>` with a descriptive Docker image name (if used)  

✅ Otherwise, the structure stays the same.

---

### **Would you like me to also create a second version for projects that are _Docker-only_ (no Python venv needed)?**  
I can prepare both if you want a **Python version** and a **Docker-only version** to just pick and drop easily. 🚀  
Would you want that?
